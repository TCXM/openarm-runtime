# Changelog

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-31

- Add the local OpenArm Platform workspace with unchanged control, teleoperation,
  tactile and vision subpages, configured single-command startup and independent
  page connections. One loopback port proxies HTTP, streaming images, Viser
  WebSockets and both nested tactile views; remote clients need only one SSH
  forward. Motor control/teleoperation switch exclusively through the existing
  shutdown paths; external services remain externally owned. Failed sensing
  services can be retried explicitly from the workspace.
- Use NiceGUI components and its FastAPI/Uvicorn server for the platform
  dashboard, with aiohttp managing upstream HTTP and WebSocket connections.
  Add the optional `platform` extra; core imports and CLI help stay passive.
  Preserve mounted module views during sensing navigation and keep the existing
  motor-control lifecycle and exclusive mode switching.
- Document replacement of standalone launches, one-port SSH access and wrist
  camera recovery using distinct USB topology paths when device serials collide.
  Hardware profiles and calibration remain external to the package.
- Validate the installed platform wheel on Linux and macOS. Browser acceptance
  covers persistent module views, HTTP/video streaming, WebSockets and clean
  shutdown with software fixtures; read-only workstation checks display all four
  cameras and both tactile viewers through the platform port.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-31

- Add the optional `openarm_tactile` capture API and `tactile` extra, pinning the
  external community Paxini SDK. Core imports remain hardware-passive and free
  of GUI/serial dependencies. SDK sources and coordinate data are not vendored.
- Add `openarm-runtime tactile` for IP-M2324-Core 68-point serial sensors, with
  explicit device ID, independent capture, stale/error state, manual reconnect
  and bounded shutdown. Raw force counts are not calibrated newtons.
- Add a left-arm dual-sensor workspace with 3D force views, point readouts, curves
  and independent controls. Preserve the browser-confirmed sensor order; both
  sensors belong to the left arm and the right arm has no tactile sensor.
- Add explicit software simulation, external workstation configuration and
  installed-package regression coverage. Previously documented dual-sensor
  hardware trials observed pressure responses and no capture errors; release
  checks are offline and do not move motors or open tactile hardware.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-31

- Dual-arm following with independent CAN workers, all-arm preflight, coordinated
  takeover, peer-fault cancellation and serialized reports. Single-arm selection remains.

- Operator-approved voltage-only leader alarms are nonblocking during physical
  following; stale/corrupt feedback, enabled leaders and other fault bits still stop.

- Optional `leader --follow` adds operator-started physical following,
  relative takeover, direct MIT targets with upstream joint-bound clipping,
  65-degree gripper mapping, stop/disconnect cleanup and reports.
  Operator-run dual-arm following completed a short trial with both disables
  verified; startup remains passive. Quantified tracking accuracy is unmeasured.
- Following no longer inherits manual-slider slew/offset restrictions. Leader
  calibration and diagnostics are collapsed by default in Viser.

- Guided manual leader calibration in Viser: arm selection, stable natural-zero
  and gripper endpoint capture, visible completeness/unsaved status and persistence.
- Capture rejects moving, stale or enabled-leader feedback and retains previous
  values on failure. Advanced direction/device controls remain available.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-31

- Add independent `openarm_video` package and `video` extra, with passive imports,
  configurable RGB/OpenNI2 sources, timestamped frames, device leases, reconnect
  lifecycle, and explicit software-only simulation.
- Add `openarm-runtime video`, packaged four-view assets, Safari-compatible finite
  JPEG/PNG requests and raw millimetre-depth download. The vendor SDK and machine
  configuration remain outside the package.
- Fix depth/profile test path comparisons on macOS and let Linux/macOS CI jobs
  complete independently.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-31

- Final whole-arm zero convergence corrects drift after intermediate zero moves;
  all eight joints must settle together before disabled-pose checks and writes.

- Calibration moves now use slow, bounded target correction for static position
  error; actual-zero tolerance and manual-hold gains are unchanged. Failure reports
  include target/goal/feedback history captured before disable.
- Calibration move/seek speeds are now 20/10 degrees per second, with ramped
  upstream per-action Kp/Kd settings. Inactive-joint failures include the offending
   feedback.

- Single-arm v2 automatic calibration over Classic CAN, available through the
  Python API, CLI and a simplified arm/action selector in the follower panel.
- Panel assumes MIT when RID10 times out, without an advanced checkbox; explicit
  non-MIT readback is still rejected. CLI/API retain the explicit timeout option.
- Bounded stop seeking, computed-zero positioning, cancellation/disable cleanup,
  and disabled-pose checks with per-motor hardware zero write reports.
- Offline virtual-stop and failure-path tests. Both arms completed zero writes
  (right 139 s, left 126 s); all 16 angle readbacks were unchanged after one user
  power cycle. Absolute accuracy and repeatability remain unquantified.
- Existing hold/leader APIs remain compatible; native SDK and CAN bitrate are
  unchanged. See `docs/calibration.md` for operation and recovery.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-31

Initial public release.

- Installable core with composable `leader`, `follower` and `viewer` extras.
- Official OpenArm CAN1.4.1 encoding, Classic CAN telemetry, whole-arm hold and
  bounded relative targets, shared bus ownership and verified disable cleanup.
- Read-only STS3215 leader transport, background reconnect and device-bound
  software pose/gripper calibration.
- Optional Viser follower panel and live leader-to-virtual-model display.
- Public Python APIs, read-only examples, wheel-based offline CI and MIT license.

Known boundaries: Python3.12; follower hardware requires Linux and the native SDK;
GUI labels are Chinese. Physical leader-to-follower teleoperation is not included.
