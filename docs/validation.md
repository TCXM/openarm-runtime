# Hardware validation

## Standalone package extraction (2026-10-31)

This repository is the extracted package, not the original research checkout.
Historical `code/hardware` paths below refer to the source project at validation time.

- Local core-only install: 59 tests, 57 passed, two skipped (external assets and
  installed-wheel-only assertion). Core imports work without GUI, serial or CAN SDK.
- Built both sdist and wheel; installed the wheel in a new Linux/Python3.12 environment
  outside either source checkout with leader/viewer extras. All59 tests passed,
  including actual official-model loading and an assertion that imports originate
  in site-packages. Tests do not inject a source directory into sys.path.
- Installed follower extra from the wheel metadata using the existing official C++
  prefix and documented build configuration. SDK1.4.1 import, all8 stateless MIT
  encoders/zero-feedforward checks and dependency compatibility checks passed.
- Extraction verification opened no CAN or serial device, enabled no motor, and did
  not replace/restart the active workstation service. The new lifecycle adapter is
  covered with mode-rejection, passive-import and exception-cleanup tests.
- Physical validation below remains the original hardware evidence. A package build
  is not new real-machine acceptance. The consumer subsequently switched to the
  installed package and repeated all59 tests successfully. Read-only checks passed
  on both CAN buses (16 motors disabled), with150 complete samples per leader bus.
  Separate Chrome checks loaded both leader and follower interfaces successfully.

## Working baseline

- Linux / Python 3.12, official OpenArm CAN SDK 1.4.1 (pinned source and uv lock),
  Classic CAN 1 Mbps through SocketCAN. No SDK fork or downgrade.
- User-confirmed wiring: can0 = right, can1 = left; IDs1–8 on each bus.
- Viser: user-triggered whole-arm enable/hold, per-joint ±30° target sliders,
  default target speed 5°/s, reference follower gains. One arm at a time.
- Startup is read-only. Control uses SDK packet encoders with fresh batch feedback;
  stopping/disconnecting attempts disable and checks each motor. No automatic zero writes.

## Hardware evidence (2026-10-30)

The user reported that the whole-arm interface moved the robot successfully.
Saved workstation reports contain arm_hold sessions on both buses and successful
disable readbacks for all eight motors of each operated arm:

- Right: `20261030T153349Z-41002449db0d4d8cbf08206cb550bab2.json`,
  `20261030T153734Z-53230d07e1864b11bbd1212b124098e8.json`.
- Left: `20261030T153827Z-aa2e82d6b0f443f38a21c4d33462a11d.json`.
- Final `end-of-day-check.json`: both buses passed, all16 status=0 (disabled).
  Viser and SSH forwarding were then stopped at the user's request.

Reports are outside Git under the workstation's `robot_deps/openarm-reports` and
`robot_deps/openarm-backups`. These establish an interactive working baseline,
not quantified trajectory accuracy, full-range acceptance or unattended reliability.

## Retained protocol findings

- Each motor's can_br must read4; host configuration must be Classic 1 Mbps.
- J1/J2 RID10 may time out despite normal state/control replies. The panel's explicit
  MIT-trial option permits this case; a readback identifying another mode still rejects.
- Right ID5 TMAX=3 Nm differs from SDK DM4310's 10 Nm. Firmware is left unchanged.
  Current commands enforce zero-feedforward bits=2047, independent of TMAX; actual
  feedback ranges are used for decoding/effort checks. Position/velocity mismatches reject.
- Command responses can arrive after the next request. Transition reads are spaced,
  previous replies drained, and enable/disable statuses confirmed with bounded waits.

## Cleanup verification (2026-10-31)

The retained SDK/Classic/whole-arm path is unchanged. Consolidated to one runtime CLI
with prepare/check/view/panel and separated operation reports from CLI code.
Superseded isolated-joint controls, unvalidated calibration/zero prototypes and the
duplicate viewer CLI/checker were archived outside the repository and removed from
the runnable tree. Protocol, shutdown, UI and model regressions remain.

Cleanup checks use offline tests, installed SDK import/encoding and model loading;
they do not start a live controller, send motor commands or alter CAN configuration.

- Local: 45 tests, 44 passed and the external-model asset test skipped.
- Workstation: all45 tests passed with the retained official model assets.
- `uv lock --check --offline`, `uv pip check`, SDK1.4.1 import and existing machine
  profile loading passed; installed SDK/uv dependencies were not rebuilt or upgraded.
- Source snapshots before cleanup are preserved outside Git in the local archive
  and workstation `openarm-backups/hardware-source-before-cleanup-20261031T104931.tar.gz`.
  Retired migration logs, DMTool inspection bundle and installer/asset transfer copies
  are grouped under `openarm-backups/retired-tools-20261031`.

## Leader-driven virtual arms (2026-10-31)

Read-only inspection on `yunzhen_ws` identified two USB serial adapters and all16
STS3215 servos (model777, IDs1–8 on each, 1 Mbps/protocol0). All torque-enable
registers read0. Stable device identities end in `5B14114594` and `5B90150374`;
their physical left/right assignment still requires a user movement check.

Using the maintained read-only SDK boundary, 30 complete eight-servo samples per
bus succeeded, averaging 3.95 / 3.89 ms per sample. The new leader Viser route was
started and browser-checked with live counts for both arms and official geometry.
Local tests: 50 passed plus one external-model skip; workstation: all51 passed.
Tests cover transmit read allowlisting, signed feedback, encoder wrap/remap/signs,
device-bound calibration persistence, stale/enabled capture rejection and failure cleanup.

A subsequent concurrent 150-cycle-per-bus read observed one voltage-error reply on
adapter `5B14114594`, ID7. Read voltage ranged3.9–4.9 V on that bus and4.4–4.9 V on
the other; configured minimum was4.0 V. Voltage-only alarms on complete, checksum-valid
replies now remain usable for virtual display and are shown as a nonblocking status.
Other servo faults, transport errors and stale samples still hide the affected arm.
Intermittent power stability therefore remains an on-site check, not a verified property.

This establishes the serial-to-model display path. User movement, physical left/right
mapping, pose alignment, joint directions and gripper endpoints await on-site confirmation.
Software calibration is intentionally separate from follower hardware calibration;
the leader route does not connect to follower CAN or send physical motion commands.

The first user trial exposed a confusing persistent zero-pose preview: serial values
changed while that checkbox deliberately froze the displayed pose. The preview was
removed. The default panel now shows two connection states, realignment and side swap;
calibration and diagnostics are collapsed. Realignment captures both current poses as
relative origins, with rollback on a failed capture. A two-frame viewer regression
checks that changed encoder inputs update both model configurations without a preview
override. Workstation tests after this correction: all52 passed. Voltage-only alarms
are also tested separately from corrupt/short reads and combined fault bits.

## Automatic calibration acceptance — 2026-10-31

One OpenArm v2 rig with stock grippers, Classic 1 Mbps and SDK1.4.1 completed
operator-started calibration on both arms. Right: 138.88 s; left: 126.12 s.
Each report contains eight stop solutions, simultaneous final-zero settling,
verified whole-arm disable, eight verified hardware zero writes and completion.
Reports and machine-specific offsets remain outside the repository.

With the arms kept in place, a user power-cycled motor power. Fresh readbacks
from all 16 motors exactly matched their pre-cycle encoder values (maximum
absolute value about 0.033 degrees). All motors remained disabled and can_br4.
This validates persistence on this rig, not absolute mechanical zero accuracy.

During the outage, active polling left both host links in ERROR-WARNING with
nonzero TX error counters. Cycling host links alone did not clear them. Bounded
read-only can_br queries confirmed the configuration, successful transmissions
reduced counters to zero, and the standard Classic checks passed. The read-only
panel was restarted. Automatic outage recovery is not yet accepted.

## Remaining follower work

Independent sign/geometry verification, gripper transmission mapping, quantified accuracy,
collision-aware joint limits and long-running/disconnect robustness are not accepted.
Calibration repeatability and multi-pose precision remain unmeasured; see
[calibration](calibration.md).
Continue new real-machine validation through explicit
user actions; the SDK's protocol range is not a mechanical safe-contact limit.
