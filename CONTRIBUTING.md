# Contributing and releasing

Keep the package small: transport, control lifecycle, mapping and optional UI
have separate responsibilities. Add features when a real consumer needs them.
New optional features should not add heavy dependencies to core imports.

## Development

Use Python3.12 and uv. `uv sync --locked` installs an editable core package;
`uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests` runs offline regressions.
For Viser development, add `--extra viewer --extra leader` to `uv sync`.
For the unified NiceGUI dashboard and aiohttp gateway, include `--extra platform`
as well. Keep the extra selections required by the modules you develop.
For RGB/depth capture and the camera web interface, use `--extra video`; run
`openarm-runtime video --simulate` for offline browser development.
For tactile capture, use `--extra tactile`; add `--extra viewer` for visualization.
`openarm-runtime tactile --simulate` uses software data without opening serial ports.
Native follower setup is documented in [workstation setup](docs/workstation.md).

When developing the runtime together with another application, install this
checkout into that application's environment in editable mode. The checkout can
live anywhere; no sibling-directory layout is required. See the README's
[installation modes](README.md#using-the-package-vs-developing-it) for pip and
uv commands, when to reinstall, and how to return to a pinned release.

Platform framework tests run with
`python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_platform*.py'` after installing
`.[platform]`. They use fake services and local test upstreams, never hardware.
Core-only tests skip framework integration checks while still checking passive
imports, configuration and subprocess ownership. CI validates both the core
wheel and the optional platform extra outside the checkout. Browser acceptance
should exercise persistent views, real Viser WebSocket events, both nested
tactile viewers and camera images through one port using software fixtures.

Tests must not open physical hardware. Test behavior at transport boundaries,
including exception cleanup, rather than copying implementation details.
Record actual hardware checks separately in [validation](docs/validation.md).
Keep device configuration, calibration, logs and cached assets outside Git.

## API changes

Keep examples and [the API guide](docs/api.md) aligned with public exports.
Use patch versions for compatible fixes and minor versions for breaking0.x API
changes. Document migrations in the changelog. Pin releases in consuming projects;
an editable install is for joint development, not a reproducible deployment.

## Release checklist

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`, `src/openarm_runtime/__init__.py` and
   version assertions in `tests/test_public_api.py`; update the changelog and
   README install tag. Run `uv lock` if package metadata/dependencies changed.
2. Run tests and `uv build`. Install the wheel in a fresh environment and run the
   tests with `OPENARM_EXPECT_INSTALLED=1`. CI performs this on Linux and macOS.
3. Commit, push and verify the CI result. Tag the tested commit `vX.Y.Z` and push
   that tag. The release workflow validates the tag/version, rebuilds and tests
   the wheel, then publishes a GitHub release with the changelog, wheel, source
   distribution and SHA256 checksums from that same commit.
4. Update downstream pins explicitly after acceptance. A release does not require
   restarting a user's live hardware services.

Releases are on GitHub. The follower extra currently contains a pinned direct Git
dependency, so a future PyPI publication needs a separate packaging review.
